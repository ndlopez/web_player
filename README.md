# Display current song playing on laPaz.fm/thirdRock

[live demo](https://ndlopez.github.io/web_player/)

Since VLC displays *stream* after opening [lapaz.fm](https://stream.consultoradas.com/8042/stream) or *thirdrock-sgplayer* when opening [thirdRock](https://rfcmedia3.streamguys1.com/thirdrock-sgplayer.aac) Thus, I decided to build a script that displays the current song playing on *lapaz.fm* or *thirdrockradio.net*

Update: *www.lapaz.fm* has changed everything. icecasthd JSON file is no longer available. 

Dev only: Open *index.html* in Firefox, the playlist will populate and update every 3.5 minutes.

By clicking on the cloud icon, it is possible to download the playlist in JSON format, obviously from the moment the page was opened.
